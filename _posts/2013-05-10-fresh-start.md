Finally, I got over my bad habit of procrastinating and updated my site. It's been forever since I touched it; mainly because I've been super busy working on different projects.

This new joint, is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub. So no more transferring files using FTP client. Source code is available to the public, so feel free to fork or contribute. If you decide to fork it, code is very easy to customize and mostly everything is declared in `_config.yml`. Things such as, title, description and usernames.

On the front end of things, I used jQuery to pull my numbers from GitHub and Themeforest. Also, I use SASS syntax in addition to Compass to create the Stylesheet. Site comes with `config.rb` file which can be imported into Codekit or any other SASS/Codekit compatible compiler and it will set all of the properties for you.
