## Setup

This is a Jekyll application, so in order to run it you'll need to have Ruby 1.9.3 or up. 

First off, you'll need to have Ruby installed. We recommend using either [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [RVM](https://rvm.io/), but your system Ruby will suffice as well. 

With Ruby installed, make sure to install the bundler gem.

```
$ gem install bundler
```

Next, download or clone this repository, change directory into it, and `bundle`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jgatjens/blog.git
$ cd blog
blog $ bundle install
```

## Running

After that, you should be all set to run the application:

```
blog $ jekyll serve --watch
```
